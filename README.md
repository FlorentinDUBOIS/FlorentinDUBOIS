### Hey there ðŸ‘‹ 

Nice to meet you! I am Florentin, a french site reliability and software engineer currently working at Clever-Cloud.

I work around distributed systems by operating and create applications on top of them. Apache [ZooKeeper](https://github.com/apache/zookeeper), [Flink](https://github.com/apache/flink), [Pulsar](https://github.com/apache/pulsar), [BookKeeper](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper), [HBase](https://github.com/apache/hbase), [Hadoop](https://github.com/apache/hadoop), Kafka and Warp 10 are a part of them. I also played a lot with [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) and [etcd](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd) clusters during my last mission at OVHcloud.

I was working at [OVHcloud](https://ovh.com) as technical leader for more than 2 years, leading technically two products (nearly one year each). The first one was Metrics Data Platform and the other one, Public Cloud Load Balancer. Between those two product, I also contribute to create another one which name is ioStream, a messaging product as a service. Before, those events, I began as a software engineer on the Metrics Data Platform product which was dealing with observability issues at cloud provider scale.

I started my IT journey, by two sandwich courses of one year each at [SII Ouest](https://sii-group.com/fr-FR/sii-ouest) and aC3, as junior software engineer.

To get in contact, I'm on Twitter under the user [@FlorentinDUBOIS](https://twitter.com/FlorentinDUBOIS).
