### Hey there ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Florentin Dubois a french software engineer located at Brest in France.

After one year of internship at [SII Ouest](https://sii-group.com/fr-FR/sii-ouest) and aC3. I work at [OVHcloud](https://ovh.com) on the load balancer 
products, but previously, I was working on the Metrics Data Platform product.

I love working around distributed systems developing tools and software on top of it. Besides, I was lucky to operate and play with Apache 
[Pulsar](https://github.com/apache/pulsar), [Hadoop](https://github.com/apache/hadoop), [HBase](https://github.com/apache/hbase), 
[BookKeeper](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper), [ZooKeeper](https://github.com/apache/zookeeper),
and now [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) & [etcd](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd).

From time to time, I gave talks about what I did, you should have a look [here](https://gist.github.com/FlorentinDUBOIS/d4097bc63cf1883b8357e9e949d45c08), 
if you are interested.
